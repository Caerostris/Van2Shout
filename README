Install---
extract Van2Shout.zip into <VanillaDir>/plugins/
Go to Dashboard->Roles & Permissions and set which group can post/view.
(i wouldnt try to give someone permissions to post, but not to view ;)
(Administrators can post and view, no matter what you set on the Dashboard...)

You can set how many messages should be shown in the shoutbox by changing $messages on line 30 in class.van2shouttext.php.


--Remove:
Go to dashboard an disable plugin, then press remove
delete <VanillaDir>/plugins/Van2Shout (if it still exists)
delete mysql table <VanillaDB>.GDN_Shoutbox


--Uprade:
delete <VanillaDir>/plugins/Van2Chat or <VanillaDir>/plugins/Van2Shout
and extract Van2Shout.zip into <VanillaDir>/plugins/
if you want to keep your old posts, rename table GDN_Chat to GDN_Shoutbox if you've been using Van2Chat, otherwhise delete GDN_Chat

--Usage:
Go to Dashboard/Roles & Permissions and give each role the permission to post in the Shoutbox, view the shoutbox or to remove messages from the shoutbox...
Start shouting ;-)
